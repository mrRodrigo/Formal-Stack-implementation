Constructor must instantiate an empty stack from the maximum stack size information. 

- Add an element at the top of the stack and return true, if added, or false, if the stack is already full 
- Remove an element from the top of the stack, if it is not empty. 
- Read the top value of the stack, without removing it. 
- Check whether the stack is full or not, returning true or false.
